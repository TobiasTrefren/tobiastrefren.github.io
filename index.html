                    Hello, my name is Tobias, and I am a computer enthusiast. I have always been curious about how to manipulate my computer to do whatever I wanted, from learning how to code, playing video games, and building my computers. I started playing video games when I was 7, and when I was 13, I taught myself LUA for Roblox. When I was 16, I transitioned into learning more complex languages like C++, Javascript, and Python. I also learned how to make my websites with HTML and CSS.

                    <br>
                    I have utilized many online resources to enhance my understanding of my curiosity. I have spent immense hours on https://www.learncpp.com/ and https://guidedhacking.com/ <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many more resources I have used. But those are the two main ones.
